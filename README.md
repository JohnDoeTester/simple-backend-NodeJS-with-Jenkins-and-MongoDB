# Simple backend app using NodeJS, Jenkins and MongoDB

In this project, I setup a pipeline on Jenkins that automatically build and deploy a Back-end Web app written in NodeJS. If user run Jenkins on personal computer, the app will allow user to access the web resource on port 8000.

User can go to: **localhost:8000/customer/create** to input information about a new customer. This information will be saved on MongoDB Atlas Cloud for later query
